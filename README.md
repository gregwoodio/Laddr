# What is Laddr?
Laddr is a capstone project developed by Greg Wood, Alan Simon, Muska Ahmadzai, and Peter Phan, 4 Sheridan Software Development & Network Engineering students.

Here's a short description
>Laddr provides users with relevant volunteering opportunities whether they are using it to complete their necessary hours of community service, or to gain experience in a field that they are pursuing a career in.

>Laddr will be accessible through Web, Android and on iOS as well.

>Not only is this a system where volunteers can easily access volunteering opportunities â€“ but it will also allow organizations who seek volunteers to easily recruit talent.

## What's in this repo?
Here is our full-stack: Node.js API backend and Angular.js front end of the website. If you're looking for our Android application, head over to [here](https://github.com/wolfishflow/laddr_droid).

## Run it on a local machine
To run it on your own machine you'll need Node, NPM, and Bower installed globally. Then clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/weirdvector/Laddr.git
```

Navigate to the directory and install NPM dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Install the front end dependencies using Bower:
```
bower install
```

Then run our Grunt task runner, which compiles our LESS, minifies CSS and uglifies JavaScript, and copies Bower dependencies to publicly accessible folders:
```
grunt
```

If you're interested in running our Node unit tests, you can do so using:
```
npm test
```

Otherwise, start the server then head over to ```http://localhost:3000``` to see the site.
```
node index.js
```

## What's in this directory?

I'm going to break down each directory with README.md file containing information about the files in it. For the root of the project, here's what you should see:
- **.bowerrc** - Our Bower configuration. This just specifies the folder to install bower components into.
- **.gitignore** - Setup to avoid polluting our repo with NPM modules and bower components we didn't write.
- **Gruntfile.js** - This is the setup file for our Grunt task runner. Like I said above, it compiles our LESS into CSS and minifies it, uglifies all of our Angular files into one laddr.min.js file, and copies our Bower components into directories that are publicly accessible on the website.
- **LadderSchema.sql** - is a copy of our database, which was useful when moving schema changes from a local machine to our server.
- **bower.json** - Contains information on all of our frontend dependencies. This file is consulted when running ```bower install```.
- **index.js** - This is our server! It's a short file, but it requires all of the other files that makes our project run. Here's where we setup our server using express, set the port number, and include other dependencies we need like body-parser. We also set routes for our static files, so Angular doesn't get in the way of looking for a CSS file. We also set up passport here, which is the module which does authentication for us. Lastly we include our routing file, and then startup the server.
- **package.json** - This is a file included in all Node projects that acts as a manifest for all dependencies, as well as specifying things like what to run for tests.
