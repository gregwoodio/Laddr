# Laddr/config/

Contains configuration files like:
- **config.js** - Our secret Twitter auth keys. Don't tell anyone!
- **database.js** - Database configuration. Again, should be secret, don't look at it.
- **passport.js** - Our setup for the passport module. It has functions for serializing/deserializing users, as well as logging in as a local and Twitter user.
- **testdatabase.js** - Same as ```database.js``` but for our testing database.
